Playground : https://bhailang.js.org/#playground
Documentation : https://github.com/DulLabs/bhai-lang

A very large number of basic coding questions will be given to the participants. 
They have to work on them as a team (this is intended to be a hinderance since the concepts are far too simple)

Progress is measured by how many questions the team has successfully completed
