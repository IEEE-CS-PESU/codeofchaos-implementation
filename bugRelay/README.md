This directory contains all the programs we'll be giving the participants for debugging.

When a team takes up a program to debug, one member will have to work on it at a time with no team communication mid event.

## VV important note : all programs have the errors mentioned in comments for evaluation purposes. Remove these before issuing the statements to the participants.
