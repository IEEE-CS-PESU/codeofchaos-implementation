# CLASH OF CODE - To be implemented on site 

## Content:

Clash of Code is a fresh way to have fun while programming. Clash of Code is a multiplayer mode where you can challenge your friends in short real-time coding battles.

**In Short**, A Very Quick Code Combat:

- The maximum time allowed for a Clash is 15 minutes, but most of them can be finished in under 5 minutes. It’s not rare to end a Clash in less than a minute.
- Some advice to new players of Clash of Code:
    1. Skim through the statement and scan the example. Usually, it’s enough to know what you have to do. If it’s not, read the statement carefully until you understand the exercise.
    2. Don’t bother with good practices. It’s a game, not a code quality competition. Code dirty.
    3. Relax! Don’t be stressed: it’s just a game after all. Most importantly, have fun!

**3 Modes of Clash of Code**

When you start a clash, the type of clash is chosen from these modes.

- Fastest: easy, you just have to be the first to pass all the tests.
- Shortest: code golf! Pass all the tests with the minimum amount of characters. Python is your best friend.
- Reverse: the statement is hidden; only test cases (input + expected output) are given. You should guess what to do. The fastest to pass the tests wins.
